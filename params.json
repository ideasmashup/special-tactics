Our team primarily consists of RTS veterans who are familiar with the game mechanics and decision-making processes.\r\n\r\nHowever, turning that instinctive human play into a computer program is no small task so we intend to imrpove the AI over time, little by little.\r\n\r\nTo evaluate and assess progress, we will register our bot to the SSCAI servers so that it can compete with other bots and clim up the rankings along with code improvements\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nThe project is still in a very early stage, so be wary of falling bugs and other such typical hazards. If you're not scared, we'll be happy to have you join us on this journey to prove that we, engineers can design the next bonjwa! Fear the wrath of the engineers petty humans! (hahaha - goes mad)\r\n\r\nJust contact any of the team members, introduce yourself, what you'd like to do and contribute to the pojrect and you're as good as a member already!\r\n\r\nAlso, \"pull requests are best resumes\" as the saying goes! You can use that too!\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\n\r\nWherever you can get to me or any team member (issues, blogs, twitter, etc)!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
