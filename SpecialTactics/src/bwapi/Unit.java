	/** The Unit class is used to get information about individual units as well as issue orders to units. Each
	* unit in the game has a unique Unit object, and Unit objects are not deleted until the end of the match
	* (so you don't need to worry about unit pointers becoming invalid).
	*<br/><br/>
	* Every Unit in the game is either accessible or inaccessible. To determine if an AI can access a
	* particular unit, BWAPI checks to see if Flag::CompleteMapInformation? is enabled. So there are two cases
	* to consider - either the flag is enabled, or it is disabled:
	*<br/><br/>
	* If Flag::CompleteMapInformation? is disabled, then a unit is accessible if and only if it is visible.
	* Note also that some properties of visible enemy units will not be made available to the AI (such as the
	* contents of visible enemy dropships). If a unit is not visible, Unit::exists will return false,
	* regardless of whether or not the unit exists. This is because absolutely no state information on
	* invisible enemy units is made available to the AI. To determine if an enemy unit has been destroyed, the
	* AI must watch for AIModule::onUnitDestroy messages from BWAPI, which is only called for visible units
	* which get destroyed.
	*<br/><br/>
	* If Flag::CompleteMapInformation? is enabled, then all units that exist in the game are accessible, and
	* Unit::exists is accurate for all units. Similarly AIModule::onUnitDestroy messages are generated for all
	* units that get destroyed, not just visible ones.
	*<br/><br/>
	* If a Unit is not accessible, in general the only the getInitial__ functions will be available to the AI.
	* However for units that were owned by the player, getPlayer and getType will continue to work for units
	* that have been destroyed. */
