/**
The Bullet class is used to get information about individual bullets, missiles, spells, and generally any sort of non-melee attack. Unlike Units, Bullet objects are reused after they are destroyed, however the ID of the bullet is updated when it represents a new bullet.
If <a href="Misc.html">Flag::CompleteMapInformation</a> is disabled, then a bullet is accessible if and only if it is visible. If a bullet is not visible, <a href="Bullet.html">Bullet::exists</a> will return false, regardless of whether or not the bullet exists. This is because absolutely no state information on invisible enemy bullets is made available to the AI.
If <a href="Misc.html">Flag::CompleteMapInformation</a> is enabled, then all bullets that exist in the game are accessible, and <a href="Bullet.html">Bullet::exists</a> is accurate for all bullets.
No message similar to <a href="AIModule.html">AIModule::onUnitDestroy</a> exists for bullets. To determine if a bullet has been destroyed, check to see if exists() is false or getID() has changed to a new value.
