/**
The Region class provides access to some of Broodwar's pathing information and offers members that can assist in navigation, scouting, construction, and information for key areas such as chokepoints. Though not always accurate, it is a lightweight alternative to BWTA that beginners can start with.
These regions are not so advanced as to cover everything up to a choke point with accurate polygons, but instead are small clusters of tiles connected to each other, kind of like a honeycomb.
