open-source starcraft broodwar AI based on BWAPI and Java

## Getting started

The best way to get up and running is to clone this repository, then follow the [Developer Guide](docs/guide.md)

## Objectives

The main goal of the project is to build a decent AI for a fast-paced strategic game like Starcraft. Our team primarily consists of RTS veterans who are familiar with the game mechanics and decision-making processes.

However, turning that instinctive human play into a computer program is no small task so we intend to imrpove the AI over time, little by little.

To evaluate and assess progress, we will register our bot to the SSCAI servers so that it can compete with other bots and clim up the rankings along with code improvements
