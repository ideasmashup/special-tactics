# special-tactics

open-source starcraft broodwar AI based on BWAPI and Java


## Getting started

First clone this repository ```git clone git@github.com:ideasmashup/special-tactics.git``` and when you're done, follow the [Developer Guide](docs/guide.md)


## Objectives

The main goal of the project is to build a decent AI for a fast-paced strategic game like Starcraft. Our team primarily consists of RTS veterans who are familiar with the game mechanics and decision-making processes.

However, turning that instinctive human play into a computer program is no small task so we intend to imrpove the AI over time, little by little.

To evaluate and assess progress, we will register our bot to the SSCAI servers so that it can compete with other bots and clim up the rankings along with code improvements


## Contributing

The project is still in a very early stage, so be wary of falling bugs and other such typical hazards. If you're not scared, we'll be happy to have you join us on this journey to prove that we, engineers can design the next bonjwa! Fear the wrath of the engineers petty humans! (hahaha - goes mad)

Just contact any of the team members, introduce yourself, what you'd like to do and contribute to the pojrect and you're as good as a member already!

Also, "pull requests are best resumes" as the saying goes! You can use that too!
