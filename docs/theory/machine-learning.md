# Machine learning

This won't be touched at first but the goal is to progressively replace hard-coded choices by statistics/data-based branching. For example instead of using hard-coded build orders, or units compositions and movements, the AI will have the ability to swap between different options (ie. polymorphic variants of each agent, with associated variable parameters).

And we will put the AI against other ennemies from within a test-map or on the online ladder to fight against opponents and start collecting data about what they do, and how each different decision impacts results. This way the AI will try out new things and using genetic algorithms a conherent behavior will emerge.

An "after-game" analysis process will examine the game execution and look for "patterns" of success/failure to watch out for, complete map-based stats on a grid to build and position units in smarter ways.
