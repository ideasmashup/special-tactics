# Experiments

These are some experiments that should be tried out to test AI features and logic

## Predicator

A special thread that extracts scouting data and reconstructs build orders from the past
and in the future. These predctions are stored in a special file that can be compared with
replay data after the game ends to verify the accuracy of every prediction

## Replicator Brain

Replace all decision-making by doing everyhing to "copy" the ennemy.
