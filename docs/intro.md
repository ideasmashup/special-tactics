# Introduction

## Why special tactics ?

This is an hommage to WhiteRa, an european starcraft progamer, who became famous for his coined "special tactics" antics. This term described his very unorthodox play-style, using surprise attacks, multiple fronts and surgical precision.

Much like the SC2 MC-style, that relies heavily on superior unit control, powerful timings and strong unit compositions.

As such this AI project will aim to build abot that provides entertaining and diverse games instead of just playing the same build over and over!

## Project goals

As expressed on the README file, the project aims to achieve a robot that can climb up the SSCAI rankings steadily, and play different races all of them running on top of the same "universal" logic and decision making system.

We dont aim (yet) for a robot capable of defeating humans progamers, but at least we'll try to make the games entertaining (using a mood-changing system to influence the AI's priorities and thus strategic choices)

## Acknowledgment
 
All this wouldn't be possible without the excellent work from :

- BWAPI
- SSCAI
- SCAIIDE
- UC Berkeley
- etc

## Ressources

To build better AIs, there are multiple open-sourced robots available (although generally written in C/C++ instead of Java) :
