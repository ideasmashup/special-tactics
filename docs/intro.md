# Introduction

## Why special tactics ?

This is an hommage to WhiteRa, an european starcraft progamer, who became famous for his coined "special tactics" antics. This term described his very unorthodox play-style, using surprise attacks, multiple fronts and surgical precision.

Much like the SC2 MC-style, that relies heavily on superior unit control, powerful timings and strong unit compositions.

As such this AI project will aim to build abot that provides entertaining and diverse games instead of just playing the same build over and over!

## Project goals

As expressed on the [README file](../README.md), the project aims to achieve a robot that can climb up the SSCAI rankings steadily, and play different races all of them running on top of the same "universal" logic and decision making system.

We dont aim (yet) for a robot capable of defeating humans progamers, but at least we'll try to make the games entertaining (using a mood-changing system to influence the AI's priorities and thus strategic choices)

## Ressources

To build better AIs, there are multiple open-sourced robots available (although generally written in C/C++ instead of Java)

**Competitions**
- [AIIDE Starctaft AI Competition](http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~cdavid/starcraftaicomp/) (every year - UC Alberta organizer)
- [Students Starcraft AI Official Homepage](http://www.sscaitournament.com/) (every year with ladder everyday for bots training matches)

**Open-source Bots**
- [List of open-source Bots](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AgVJe-WqYP5LdFBwLVhrNFhBODFZNFVNdS11bFl4enc&usp=sharing)
- [UAlberta Bot](https://code.google.com/p/ualbertabot/) (C++)

*Since 2013, all AIIDE participating Bots must be open-sourced (we'll have a few more after August 2014's AIIDE session ends)*

**APIs and Bots**
